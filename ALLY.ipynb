    "# OBJECTIVE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this code is to create a disease detection and healthcare assistance chatbot. The chatbot is designed to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Disease Detection: It asks the user for symptoms they are experiencing and predicts the possible disease based on those symptoms using a trained Naive Bayes classifier model. It then provides information about the predicted disease, suggests a specialist doctor to consult, and gives recovery steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Insurance Assistance: If the user is interested, the chatbot provides information about health insurance plans, including their benefits and types. It allows the user to explore different types of health insurance plans, provides details about each type, and even assists in applying for a specific plan by offering relevant links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive Chatting: The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user, asking relevant questions, providing responses based on user input, and offering assistance accordingly."
