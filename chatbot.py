    Individual health insurance is a type of insurance plan that provides medical coverage to individuals based on their specific sum insured.
    Unlike group or family health insurance plans, individual health insurance requires separate purchases for each family member.
    This allows for personalized coverage based on individual health needs, rather than covering the entire family.
    Individual health insurance plans typically offer extensive coverage for emergency medical expenses, including hospitalization costs, day care procedures, road ambulance services, alternative treatments, organ donor expenses, and more.
    However, it's important to note that the premium and coverage of an individual health policy cannot be shared among family members.

    If you have a dependent family with parents, spouse, children, and siblings, it is important to buy a health insurance policy for all your family members.

    In this type of plan, the sum insured will be shared by all the family members.
    In fact, it is an economical insurance plan which means a single floater policy in which the policyholder pays a single premium amount to get coverage for all family members.
